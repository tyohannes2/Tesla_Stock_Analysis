ðŸ“ˆ Tesla Stock Price Prediction with Linear Regression
This project uses historical stock data for Tesla (TSLA) and applies a Linear Regression model to predict closing stock prices based on Open and High prices. It also evaluates model performance and visualizes prediction accuracy.

ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries Used
Python

pandas

numpy

matplotlib / seaborn

scikit-learn (LinearRegression, train_test_split, mean_squared_error, r2_score)

yfinance (for live stock data)

ðŸ“Š Project Workflow
Data Collection
Collected Tesla stock data using the yfinance library from January 2015 to July 2025.

Data Preparation

Cleaned the dataset

Selected relevant features: Open and High to predict Close

Modeling

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20)

Trained a Linear Regression model

Evaluation

Calculated Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Measured RÂ² Score to assess accuracy

Visualization

Tesla Stock Price, 2019-2024
Tesla Stock Price with Moving Prices
Plotted actual vs. predicted closing prices

ðŸ§ª Results
Mean Squared Error: 1024.37

RÂ² Score: 0.699
(Shows a moderate correlation between predicted and actual values)
